# TraceSphere ðŸ’«

A generative visualization that traces particles over a spherical surface in 3D space - built using openFrameworks.<br>
Inspired by particle systems and geometric motion, this project explores visual expression through motion and persistence.

## Demo ðŸ“·

## Usage ðŸš€

1. Clone or download this repository and place it under openFrameworks/apps/myApps/.

2. Use the projectGenerator to set up the project.

3. Build and run the project.

4. Control the camera with your mouse to explore the trails drawn over the spherical surface.

## Features ðŸ“¦

- Particles that move over a spherical surface
- Persistent trail rendering
- Interactive 3D camera view
- Frame rate-stabilized update control


## Inspiration ðŸ’¡

This project is inspired by natural traces of motion â€” such as the paths of particles, celestial bodies, or wind.<br>
It combines geometric motion and generative aesthetics using openFrameworks' 3D capabilities to create a visually experimental piece.

## Built With ðŸ”§

- openFrameworks â€” C++ creative coding toolkit
- Core components used: ofEasyCam, ofVboMesh, ofPolyline, etc.
